I wouldn't suggest cloning this repo becuase I'm not sure what would happen (too lazy to research or experiment)

Instead these are just for reference to remember what kind of setup was done on my main system.

TODOS/NOTES/Challenges:

- Possible Solution to below: Use separate branches for each system
- Figure out how to make this work for multiple systems with different files.
    If I setup a new system with different configs then we'd have out-of-sync repos, unnecessary files in systems, etc..

- I might be able to use symlinks & note files or something.
- Maybe this just won't work outside of the home directory.
- I was trying to find a way to keep track of all system files I've edited so I don't have to remember all the setup tasks on a new system.

For example: setting CTRL to CAPS in the /etc/default/keyboard file.
